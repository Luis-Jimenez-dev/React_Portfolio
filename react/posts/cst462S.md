Provides students with key knowledge of race, gender, class and social justice

Students will engage in a practical experience in the community via their service
placements, which will provide depth and context for considering questions
of justice, equality, social responsibilities and the complexities of technology
and its societal impact. The course uses scenario based approach combining
presentations, discussions, and reflections to allow students explore the 
relationship between critical reelection and action on the topics mentioned above.
