# Course Objective:
Survey of Telecomm and Data comm Technology Fundamentals, Local Area Network,
Wide Area Network, Internet and internetworking protocols including TCP/IP,
network security and performance, emerging industry trends such as voice
over the network and high speed networking. Designed as a foundation for
students who wish to pursue more advanced network studies including certificate 
programs. Includes hands on networking labs that incorporate Cisco CCNA lab components.

# TCP Client & Server:
During this course, we focused on the networking side of computers by learning how data
is sent over a network. We learned the various ways that servers operate and how they
communicate with one another through packets. A project that we worked on during our
studies was a TCP Client & Server which was completed as a group project. 

## Client Code:

``` python
    # CST 311 - Programming Assignment 3 - TCP Client
    # This program acts as the client for the TCP client/server assignment
    # requirement, sending inputted messages to the server.
    # Team 4/BayTech - Luis Jimenez-Barrios, Warren Ngoun, Yukio Rivera, Jeannah Yasin
    from socket import *

    # Server Connection Variables
    serverName = '127.0.0.1'
    serverPort = 12000

    # Socket Variable and Connection
    clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    clientSocket.connect((serverName, serverPort))

    # While loop tracker
    # Only acts on two messages: A connection message & a final results message.
    while testCase:
        # Receive results, print them, prep tempSplit for later testing
        result = clientSocket.recv(1024).decode()
        print(result)
        tempSplit = result.split(" ")

        # Case for first Connection message, just check strings
        if (result == 'Client X Connected' or result == 'Client Y Connected'):
            message = input("Enter message to send to server: ")
            clientSocket.send(message.encode())

        # Case for FINAL connection message w/ first sender results
        # Checking by using Split to see the first few chars of 'X/Y:'
        elif(tempSplit[0] == 'X:' or tempSplit[0] == 'Y:'):
            testCase = False

    # Close down the socket once we've gotten final message
    clientSocket.close()
```

## Server Code:

``` python
    # CST 311 - Programming Assignment 3 - TCP Server
    # Team 4/BayTech: Luis Jimenez-Barrios, Warren Ngoun, Yukio Rivera, Jennah Yasin
    # This program acts as the server for the TCP client/server assignment
    # requirement, the in-between message manager between Clients X & Y.

    # 11 - We need multithreading for this assignment to handle two different
    # clients concurrently. In other words, multithreading is needed so that the
    # server can handle multiple connections at the same time. Multithreading
    # prevents the recv connection socket line from blocking the main server thread
    # when more than one client attempts to access it as now each child thread will
    # block individually when they need to and our main/other threads can work as
    # needed.

    # Imports needed for sockets & threading/semaphores
    from multiprocessing import Semaphore
    from socket import *
    import threading

    serverPort = 12000      # port declaration

    # Create two binary lock semaphores for later mutexing
    firsConnCheck = Semaphore(1)
    secondCheck = Semaphore(1)

    # Lists for keeping track of data in-between threads, need lists b/c they
    # are mutable and so values can be changed.
    firstClientChecker = [0, 0]     # Variables for determining Client X/Y
    secondResponse = [0]        # Global list counter for keeping track of 2nd msg received
    clientMsg = [0, 0]      # List to keep track of text of first/second msg
    clientMsgCnt = [0]      # List to keep count of num of messages sent already

    threadTracker = [] # List to keep track of active threads

    class connectionThread (threading.Thread):
        def __init__(self, connectionSocket):
            threading.Thread.__init__(self)

            self.connSock = connectionSocket

            # respective details too.

            # sends upon both connections. If two connections haven't been
            # confirmed yet, it'll spin indefinitely waiting.
