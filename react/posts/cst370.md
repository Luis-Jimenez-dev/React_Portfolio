# Course Objective:
Students learn important data structures in Computer Science and acquire fundamental
algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing
problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency,
hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, transform-
and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming.

## Example Algorithm
``` C++
    /*
    * INSTRUCTION:
    *     This is a C++ starting code for hw6_2.
    *     When you finish the development, download this file.
    *     Note that the current filename is "main.cpp".
    *     But rename it to "main_hw6_2.cpp".
    *     After that, upload the renamed file on Canvas.
    */

    // Finish the head comment with Abstract, Name, and Date.
    /*

    * Abstract: Program that implements Floyd's Algorithm to display all-pairs shortest paths
