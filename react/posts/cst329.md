# Course Objective:
In this course students learn to develop skills in using logic to describe and asses arguments. Students will
learn to write formulas in propositional and first-order logic, and more importantly, to write and check
proofs. Students will also learn to write formulas in three-valued and modal logic, know how to choose
an appropriate logic, and understand the limitations of logic in capturing human reasoning.

## Example Proofs:

### FOL Proofs
