## Intro:
Hello, this webpage is designed as a blog post. As for the website content, it will
display my school work and projects completed until now. I will continue to update it 
regularly when I complete new projects or learn something interesting.

## Project:
Throughout this project I learned how to develop a web application using the next.js framework.
This learning experience developed a greater understanding of JavaScript, api's use for
fetching data, and development using Markdown(md) files. My greatest challenge was learning how to implement
and use md files to display data. This was due to the fact that I wanted to display them dynamically
from a folder which required turning the md data into html. Luckily this didn't take too long to learn
thanks to the tutorial course on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=navbar&utm_campaign=home)
website.

## Conclusion:
Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully I can populate this website with many interesting projects and posts.
